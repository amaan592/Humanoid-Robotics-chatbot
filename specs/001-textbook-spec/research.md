# Research Document: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Overview
This research document outlines the approach for developing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook, addressing all technical and structural requirements defined in the specification.

## Chapter Structure and Sequence
Based on the specification requirements, the textbook will follow this progressive sequence:
1. Foundations (Weeks 1-2): Core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. Sensors (Weeks 3-4): Sensor systems and integration for humanoid robots
3. ROS (Weeks 5-6): Robot Operating System fundamentals and architecture
4. Simulation (Weeks 7-8): Gazebo simulation environment and digital twins
5. Locomotion (Weeks 9-10): Movement and control systems for humanoid robots
6. Embodiment (Weeks 11-13): Autonomous humanoid control and advanced integration

## Technical Stack Implementation Plan
