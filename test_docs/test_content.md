## Introduction to Robotics

Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. It deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

## Physical AI Concepts

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. These systems must understand and manipulate physical objects, navigate physical spaces, and respond to physical forces and constraints.

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the theory that many features of human and animal intelligence are shaped by the physical body and its interactions with the environment. This approach suggests that intelligence emerges from the interaction between brain, body, and environment.
