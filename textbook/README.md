# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This is a graduate-level textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, covering embodied intelligence, humanoid control systems, and physical-world AI deployment.

## Structure

The textbook is organized into 6 major parts:
1. Foundations - Core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
2. Sensors - Sensor systems and perception for humanoid robots
3. ROS - Robot Operating System fundamentals and ecosystem
4. Simulation - Gazebo simulation and digital twin concepts
5. Locomotion - Movement control and kinematics for humanoid robots
6. Embodiment - Autonomous control and advanced integration

## Academic Standards

This textbook maintains graduate-level engineering documentation standards with formal, robotics-lab precise language. All content focuses on professional-grade robotics systems including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, locomotion, sensors, perception, and humanoid interaction.

## Building the Textbook

To build and run the textbook locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a local development server where you can view the textbook.
