# Humanoid Interaction

## Overview

This chapter explores human-robot interaction principles and techniques specifically for humanoid robots, covering perception, communication, and collaborative behaviors.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
- Implement perception systems for human detection and tracking
- Design interaction modalities for humanoid robots
- Create collaborative behaviors for human-robot teams

## Prerequisites

Completion of previous chapters on perception, control, and locomotion

## Duration

Estimated completion time: 1 week

## Content

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned for human-robot interaction due to their human-like form, which can facilitate more intuitive and natural interactions compared to other robot forms.

### Social Perception

Understanding humans in the robot's environment:

- **Person Detection**: Identifying humans in sensor data
- **Pose Estimation**: Understanding human body posture and orientation
- **Gesture Recognition**: Interpreting human gestures and movements
- **Face Recognition**: Identifying and tracking individuals

### Interaction Modalities

Different ways humanoid robots can interact with humans:

- **Verbal Communication**: Speech recognition and synthesis
- **Gestural Communication**: Using robot body language
- **Proxemic Behavior**: Managing personal space and social distance
- **Attention Control**: Directing and responding to attention

### Collaborative Behaviors

Designing robot behaviors for human collaboration:

- **Intention Recognition**: Understanding human goals and plans
- **Predictive Behavior**: Anticipating human actions
- **Adaptive Interaction**: Adjusting to individual human preferences
- **Social Norms**: Following cultural and social conventions

## Technical Focus

Implementation of interaction systems using ROS 2, with integration of perception, planning, and control systems for natural human-robot interaction.

## Next Steps

The final chapter will explore advanced integration topics for complete humanoid systems.
