# Glossary of Robotics Terminology

This glossary provides standardized definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

**Autonomous Control**: The ability of a robot to perform tasks without human intervention, typically involving perception, planning, and actuation systems working together.

## B

**Behavior-Based Robotics**: An approach to robotics that structures robot control as a collection of behaviors that can be combined and coordinated.

## C

**Control Architecture**: The organizational structure of a robot's control system, defining how different control components interact and coordinate.

## E

**Embodied Cognition**: The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the environment.

**Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between a physical agent and its environment, where the body plays a crucial role in cognitive processes.

**Environment Modeling**: The process of creating digital representations of the physical environment for simulation or planning purposes.

## G

**Gazebo**: A robot simulation environment that provides realistic sensor simulation and multiple physics engines for complex robot scenarios in 3D worlds.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot with human-like form and capabilities, typically featuring legs, arms, and a head with human-like degrees of freedom.

## I

**Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: A device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

## L

**Locomotion**: The act of moving from one place to another, particularly relevant for legged robots and humanoid systems.

## M

**Morphological Computation**: The idea that the physical form and material properties of a robot contribute to its computational and control processes.

## N

**NVIDIA Isaac**: A robotics platform and tools ecosystem that provides simulation, perception, and control capabilities for robotics applications.

## P

**Perception**: The process of interpreting sensory information to understand the environment and the robot's state within it.

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that exist and operate in the physical world, interacting with real environments through sensors and actuators.

**Proprioceptive Sensors**: Sensors that measure internal state of the robot, such as joint angles, motor currents, and IMU data.

**Proactive Control**: Control systems that anticipate future states and act accordingly, rather than simply reacting to current inputs.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions.

**ROS 2**: The second generation of the Robot Operating System with improved architecture for real-world deployment.

**Reactive Behavior**: Robot behaviors that respond directly to environmental stimuli without planning or anticipation.

**Request/Response**: A synchronous communication pattern in ROS where one node sends a request and waits for a response from another node.

## S

**Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to achieve better accuracy and reliability than individual sensors can provide.

**Simulation-to-Reality Transfer**: The process of applying knowledge, behaviors, or control policies learned in simulation to real-world robotic systems.

**State Estimation**: The process of determining the internal state of a robot based on sensor measurements and control inputs.

## T

**TF (Transform Framework)**: A component of ROS that enables robots to keep track of coordinate frames over time.

**Topics**: In ROS, streams of messages passed between nodes implementing a publish/subscribe communication pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing a robot model including kinematic and visual information.

## V

**Visual Perception**: The process of interpreting visual information from cameras to understand the environment and objects within it.

## W

**Whole-Body Control**: A control approach that considers the entire robot's dynamics and constraints simultaneously rather than controlling individual parts separately.
